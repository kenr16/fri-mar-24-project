            <h4>Do you prefer to work with small or large business organizations?</h4>
            <p>Large businesses may have a more structured enviroment in which some people thrive, they also offer far more stability.  However, a smaller business will be more flexible and may offer more opportunities for faster growth.  Finding an enviroment in which you can thrive may be beneficial to your career.</p>

            <p>Working directly for a large organization will once again offer far more structure, stability and usually a very steady stream of work.  Working as an outside contractor or for an agency will allow you more freedom to choose which projects you will work on and may offer better pay, if less consistently.</p>

            <h4>Do you prefer to work on visible areas of a program or back end-logic?</h4>
            <p>Front-end or user-side areas of a program are the parts of a webpage or app that a user can see and interact with.  These parts of the program are usually responsible for gathering data from user-input fields and allowing for user interactivity.  People who enjoy this kind of work will like working with layouts and visual images.  Back-end or business logic is the part of the program that the user cannot see.  This type of work involves lots of logic and calculations.</p>

            <p>Android is a very popular on smart phones, and being able to program for smartphones allows you to reach a wider audience.  This is especially true in the developing world, where a smart phone is the only sourse of net access for many people.  Windows is far more common on desktop computers and is probably the most widely used operating system for both businesses and home users.</p>
