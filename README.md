#### _Ken Rutan's Programming Track Selector, March 24th, 2017_

#### By _**Ken Rutan**_

## Description

_This is a program that will ask you a series of question on your preferences and then select which course at Epicodus in portland it feels is the best fit for you personally and professionally.  It requires the use of multiple input forms and the use of global variables, which, although frowned upon, are actually put to very good use here.  Once the questions have all been answered, a final suggestion will be made on which track is right for you.
The complete repository can be found on GitHub at the following address:_
